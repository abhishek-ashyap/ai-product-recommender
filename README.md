ShopAI 🛍️An intelligent, AI-powered e-commerce assistant that understands natural language.Live Demo💻 Tech StackFrontendAI & APIDeployment📝 DescriptionShopAI is a modern product recommendation engine designed to replace traditional keyword search filters. Instead of ticking boxes for "Price: Low to High" or "Category: Electronics," users can simply talk to the app like a human.Inspired by the shift towards Generative AI, this project uses Google's Gemini API to analyze a user's intent (e.g., "I need a setup for streaming games under $500") and intelligently matches it against a static product inventory. It demonstrates how LLMs can be integrated into frontend applications to create intuitive user experiences.✨ Features🧠 Semantic Understanding: The AI understands context. "Budget-friendly" maps to low prices; "Audiophile" maps to high-quality audio gear.⚡ Lightning Fast: Built with Vite for instant server start and hot module replacement.🎨 Modern UI: A clean, responsive interface designed with Tailwind CSS, featuring smooth transitions and loading states.🛡️ JSON-Mode AI: Uses advanced prompt engineering to ensure the AI returns strict data for the application to render, preventing hallucinations.📱 Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.🚀 DeploymentThe project is deployed and hosted on Vercel.🛠️ InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-product-recommender.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-product-recommender.git)
